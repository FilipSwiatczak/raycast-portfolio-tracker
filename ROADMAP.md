## PHASE 1 continued

1. Base functionality: accounts, positions, apis, raycast front-end ✅
2. Prettify the UI and UX (this is a conversation mode - I'll describe in detail, back and forth with hot-reloads) ✅
3. Add cash positions handling ✅
4. Add option to rename assets - custom name. Where over hover and in detailed view it would show original name. This is sometimes needed when Yahoo api returns cryptic names for certain assets. Batch rename is also supported where post-renaming a tooltip asks if other matchins assets should be renamed ✅
5. Add a github pipeline for unit testing and linting, with separate PR branch and main treatment. ✅
6. Fix "Add Position", where after adding, the context returns to search, leading user to believe the next search would add another position. This is a good flow overall. However the next search and "Add" in fact overwrites the previous position. Keep the flow but fix so that the next search Add adds a new position. ✅

## PHASE 2

1. FIRE Dashboard — Financial Independence, Retire Early tracking. Separate command. 🔧
   - Setup form: target value (with spending calculator helper), withdrawal rate, inflation, growth rate, year of birth, holiday entitlement, SIPP access age, account exclusion ✅
   - Projection engine: year-by-year compound growth with real returns (growth − inflation), half-year contribution approximation ✅
   - ASCII horizontal bar chart in Raycast Detail markdown with target line marker and 🎯 FIRE year highlight ✅
   - Dashboard with metadata panel: FIRE year, age, days/working days to FIRE, progress %, contributions summary, assumptions ✅
   - Contributions management: single-frame rendering (list/add phases), position picker grouped by account, add/remove with persistence ✅
   - Account exclusion from FIRE calculation ✅
   - 109 unit tests for calculator + chart builder ✅
   - UX iteration (hot-reload polish pass) ✅
   - Show Contributions growth with different color to starting portfolio bulk sum ✅
   - Create pretty SVG chart with fallback to ASCII (later will expose as stylistic choice) ✅
   - Advanced: New SVG, below in the dashboard. Shows Split projection by accessible (ISA/GIA) vs locked (SIPP/401K) accounts with SIPP access age gate. Clear values shown on each bar part. So in each interval, two bar parts with two values displayed right over them. ✅
2. Add Coast FIRE mode as a selectable option from a dropdown in the top right of the FIRE Dashboard. This mode adds two inputs and a section to FIRE settings called "Coast Fire". It takes two mutually exclusive parameters, either "Years till Coast FIRE" or "Coast Retirement target year". The COAST idea is to stop having to contribute to portfolio growth (allowing for part time or lighter income stream). Users will want to find out when they can start Coasting given a specified retirement target, or conversely, given a specified Coast target, when they can stop contributing and start coasting. The projection engine will need to be adapted to calculate the Coast target value based on the specified retirement year and assumptions, or calculate the Coast FIRE year based on the specified target value and assumptions. The dashboard will also need to be adapted to display the Coast target line on the chart and include relevant metadata in the panel. 🔧 techically this is a combination of projections with and without contributions (I guess calculate the contribution-less growth vector for each year of standard display, then check the earlier date that matches or exceeds the target budget - you might have a better/smarter way to handle this).
3. Fix "Search Investments" not to assume an Account but start search, then on found entry, have add to account -> select account (with option to add new account) -> confirm asset details (with option to edit name, units, price) -> add position.
4. Add Mortgage handling as an asset class. On addition ask for Total Value, Current Equity, date of valuation and post code. Create a service to fetch the price percentage change since valuation date based on the postcode (using a property price index).
5. Add Import/Export functionality. Separate command. Export to CSV with columns for account, asset name, symbol, units, price, total value, currency, and last updated date. Import from CSV with same format, with validation and error handling for missing/invalid fields. Support for multiple accounts via account column. 🔧

## PHASE 3

1. Add portfolio graph over time. Separate command. Two displays: Line chart with adjustable time frame (both range and granularity(day, week:default, month, year)) showing the total asset value over time. Second graph showing same broken into a data series (line) for each account. Without pulling backdated asset valuation, with initial portfolio, this will be a single dot line on the graph - this is fine for this stage.
